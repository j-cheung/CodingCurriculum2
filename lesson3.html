					<b>Lesson 3 Teacher's Notes</b><br>
					<br>
					<b>Lesson Aim:</b><br>
					1. To understand how to use the button on the Engduino<br>
					2. To effectively change the colour intensity of the LEDs<br>
					The main purpose of this lesson is to look at the hardware properties of the Engduino. How can students use code to interact with these features? And how can they develop more complex programs as a result?<br>
					What you want students to think about when it comes to the button is what it means when the button is pressed and after it is pressed. These two concepts differ greatly.<br>
					In addition to this you want to show students that as well as the colours, there is the ability to specify the type of each colour whether that be a lighter shade or darker shade.<br>
					<b>The Button</b><br>
					Show off the example code for when the button is pressed. Explain how the code within the if-statement is never executed by default as the loop cycles though the code. But once the condition inside the loop is true (i.e. the button is currently pressed) the loop will enter the if-statement as it cycles through the code. The button always has to be pressed if the code inside the if-statement wishes to execute.<br>
					Alternatively you have the scenario whereby the code executes after the button is pressed. Re-iterate that before, the button had to be pressed while in this case, the code inside an if-statement only executes AFTER the button is pressed and not WHILE it is pressed.<br>
					Talk about some real life examples of when the two different button commands can be used. An example is the idea that code executed if the button WAS pressed normally acts as an on and off installation. If button is pressed usually signals a temporary alternative for a continuous program.<br>

				<b>Activity</b><br>
				Have students set up a program in which a variable holding a value changes every time the button is pressed. For example after the button is pressed increase the variable by 100. The variable could be the value for the delay command. Therefore as the variable increases by 100 the program will delay for longer periods<br>
				<b>Colour Intensity</b><br>
				Start off by simply explaining what colour intensity is. You have darker and lighter shades of each colour. You can even introduce a real life example of how such a property can be useful. For example a metal detector could shine dark blue for no metal in the nearby vicinity and light blue for metal very close by.<br>
				Touch Develop allows the user to specify darker and lighter shades. It goes further by letting you select the level of shading- 0.1 being the lowest and 0.9 being the greatest. Students will gain a greater appreciation for this feature if they see a colour intensity change in action. This is a good opportunity to bring in the button. Take the example with the variable but instead while the button IS pressed, make the shade of colour darken or lighten.<br>
				Let students play around with the decimal values between 0.1-0.9.<br>
