					<b>Lesson 1 Teacher's Notes</b><br>
					<br>
					<b>Lesson Aim:</b><br>
					1. To introduce students to the touch develop language<br>
					2. To have students use some basic Engduino commands<br>
					3. To introduce idea of loops and the computational approach to them<br>
					4. To understand the purpose of variables<br>
					The two loops that will be covered are the while loop and for loop.<br>
					Explain the purpose of loops. What would be the alternative approach to executing multiple commands otherwise? Why is this approach less efficient? How do loops save space and memory?<br>
					<b>Activity</b><br>
					Have the students for example turn an LED at location 1 on. What happens? In theory it should turn on but for less than a second and consequently you will miss it or perceive it as a flash.<br>
					Ask them to light the LED for more than 10 seconds. Explain that the same command would have to be repeated 100s or even 1000s of times to achieve this and as a result it will be inefficient to copy and paste the same command.<br>
					Introduce the while loop. Explain how it continuously iterates over and over like a cycle as long as a condition is true.<br>
					(At this stage it is not necessary to introduce the idea of Boolean logic. If you feel it would be useful simply illustrate the idea of true or false, right or wrong, on or off or however you feel it would be best conveyed)<br>

					<b>Engduino</b><br>
					There will be a basic template and layout provided for students to use in the further lessons. This requires no extensive explanation. Simple explain that it is a default set out for code to be inserted inside of.<br>
					Let the students play around with the LED commands.<br>
					Get them to use the different colours and if they feel confident enough, to switch between colours.<br>
					Explain the purpose of the delay command. How it creates a pause within the program. Any commands after it will not execute until it finishes. Delay(####) uses milliseconds. Provide the conversion 1000 milliseconds per second so they can accurately compute the command in seconds.<br>
					<b>Variables</b><br>
					Variables are effectively storage locations for different elements. To convey this message start with numbers and portray these variables as carriers for specific numbers. These carriers can have almost any name. Teach the importance of the naming conventions. Make sure they understand that the name of variable describes the value it holds.<br>
					<b>Activity</b><br>
					You could get the students to store their age, height, weight, house number and telephone into variables. Make sure they name each variable accordingly.<br>
