					<b>Teacher’s Notes: Lesson 5</b><br><br>
					<b>Lesson Aim: </b><br>
					1.	To understand how to use the temperature sensors <br>
					2.	To know how to print values to the wall<br>
					3.	To establish a temperature range<br>
					This lesson will be more theory based than the previous 2 lessons.  Students will be introduced to the temperature sensor and how it can read values that in turn print on to the wall.<br>
					This will be the first time students have interacted with the wall so it would be advisable to spend some time playing with it and getting a familiarity for how it works.<br>
					<b>The Wall</b><br>
					The concept involves creating a variable and signalling that variable to be posted to the wall.  Students can either write this code on a single line or first create a variable holding a value and then on another line writing the command “post to wall”.
					Show students the basic process of writing the code and then task them with carrying out similar activities.<br>

					<b>Activity</b><br>
					You could write some code in advance and take a screenshot of how it appears on the wall.  Then ask students to make code that prints the same result<br>
					<b>The Temperature Sensors</b><br>
					Demonstrate to students how to setup the sensors and point out the importance of subtracting 273 from the variables.  The reason for this is due to the fact Touch Develop works in conjunction with the American measuring system.  By default the measuring unit for temperature is Kelvin (K) and 0 Degrees Celsius is equivalent to 273K.  Instruct students to take this approach when dealing with temperature sensors for future preference.<br>
					The lesson activity is to be completed by students, but if they struggle to complete it, give them the code and let them experiment with the program.  Let them get a feel for the sensors and how the values on the wall change as the Engduino moves around the room
					The final page is a preview to what is to be expected in the next lesson.  Students will be expected to establish a temperature range.  Let them brainstorm on how they will achieve this.  Temperature ranges rely on various factors from the external environment to the accuracy of the Engduino hardware.  Setting up a default range for students to work with is preferable before this lesson.  For example if the room is abnormally hot or abnormally cold the range will have to be adjusted accordingly.<br>
