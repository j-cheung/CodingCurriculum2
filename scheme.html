					<b>Touchdevelop 6 week course overview</b><br>
					During this six-week course, our aim is to raise interest for computer science amongst high school students. The lessons provided cover the basics of programming such as variables, if statements and loops. Detailed Touchdevelop tutorials provided will introduce students to these concepts in a very clear and concise manner. Furthermore, students will be able to extend their knowledge by making practical applications. Using Engduino microprocessors will allow students to see the outcome of their work in a more visually appealing way as well as will let them to interact with the hardware directly.<br>
					<b>Aims of the course</b><br>
					This course will allow students to learn more about computational thinking and the structure of the hardware. Creating simple programs will give them an insight of how all the electronic equipment around us works and outline the importance of coding in larger and more complex systems that we use in our everyday life.<br>

					<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
					By the end of this course, students should be able to:<br>
					•	Understand the concept of a variable<br>
					•	Work with simple if statements and loops<br>
					•	Use light and temperature sensors<br>
					•	Understand the specifics of the Engduino (e.g. LED lighting delays)<br>
					•	Grasp the basic idea of a function<br>
					Taking this course as a foundation will greatly ease their life at university due to these concepts being mandatory to learn on every Computer Science course.<br>
					On the other hand, Engduino provides them an insight of how sensors work in real life and therefore students will gain a deeper understanding of how hardware around them works. For example, by creating a simple program which reads the values of temperature sensor, students will have an idea of how air conditioners and heating systems operate. As a result, the course will provide students with necessary theoretical foundations and introduce them to their practical application. <br><br>
					While meeting with the teacher, she requested that instead of focusing on a STEM theme – our curriculum should instead focus on developing computational thinking within the students. We chose to use situated cognition as the theory behind the classes. We introduced the basic concepts of programming and utilised visually appealing aspects of the Engduino alongside sensors which students can easily relate to.<br>
