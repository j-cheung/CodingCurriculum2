					<b>Title</b><br>
					<br>
					Touch Develop programming course for secondary school students.<br>
					<br>

					<b>Theme</b><br>
					<br>
					Coding exercises in conjunction with physics related topics.<br>
					The aim of these learning exercises is to introduce students to the world of programming.  They will work with a language called touch develop whereby they will learn and eventually write basic code.  The programs they work with will implement some of the core principles associated with physics.<br>
					<br>

					<b>Scope</b><br>
					<br>
					The course will contain 12 exercises ranging from beginner exercises to intermediate level.  The purpose of this course is intended for students aged 11+.<br>
					<br>

					<b>Learning Outcomes</b><br>
					<br>
					1.	Understand the importance of programming and its uses<br>
					2.	Confidently use the Touch Develop Programming language<br>
					3.	Understand the key fundamental concepts of both programming and key stage 2/3 physics<br>
					4.	Hopefully want to engage with programming further into their academics<br>

					<b>Content</b><br>
					<br>
					Tutorials 1-11: The initial set of exercises and tutorials will cover the main programming concepts such as variables, loops and if statements.<br>
					The next set of tutorials will integrate physics problems and take what students have learnt from the previous lessons.<br>
					The final tutorials will elaborate on what students already know and use these skills for the more complex coding scenarios.<br>
					Alongside the tutorials will be exercise questions for students to complete on their own or within a group for later assessment.<br>
					<br>

					<b>Resources Required</b><br>
					<br>
					Students will require a computing device (i.e. computer, phone, tablet etc.) with online connectivity.  They will need to access the Touch Develop Website and access the course accordingly.<br>
