					<b>Teacherâ€™s Notes: Lesson 4</b><br>
					<br>
					<b>Lesson Aim: </b><br>
					1.	To review the content from the previous lessons<br>
					2.	To expand on computational thinking with an array of exercises<br>
					During this lesson students will be presented with exercises of varying difficulty.  The answers are provided at the end of the slides and it would be preferable if you reviewed these in preparation for the lesson.  <br>
					It is likely some students will accomplish certain activities faster than others so for practical reasons it would be advisable to maybe print off each question and give each student an individual copy.<br>
					<b>Question 1</b><br>
					The first activity is mathematical based and encompasses the idea of loops and if statements.  Students will be expected to cycle through the loop and increase the value of x accordingly.  <br>
					<b>Question 2</b><br>
					This exercise is a set of questions covering the topics from the previous 3 lessons<br>
					<b>Question 3</b><br>
					In this activity there are missing words that each student is required to fill in.  This exercise should be fairly simple and it would be worth testing the code after to see if it works.<br>

					<b>Question 4</b><br>
					Question 4 expands on the colour intensity theme.  It is expected to test if students remember what colour shades the values and commands correlate to. <br>
					Extension: It is worth getting the students to explore the result of exceeding the range of values (less than 0.1 or more than 0.9).  Get them to explore the results.<br>
					<b>Question 5</b><br>
					This will be the hardest exercise students would have encountered so far.  They are expected to set up a while loop and an if-statement for when the button is being pressed.<br>
					<b>Question 6</b><br>
					Essentially this exercise will involve LEDs turning on and off to create the effect of a light running anticlockwise around the Engduino.  As before there will need to be a while loop and if-else-statement.  It is important students grasp the concept of changing the colour of the previous LED to black when the next one flashes red.  The addition of the delay command provides a better visual effect.<br>
					For the extension task students need to reverse the sequence of flashes in a clockwise direction.  It requires a change of the initial variable and instead of incrementing x, students are expected to decrement x.<br>
